# Filament
3d printer filament and calculations and data that is related to 3d prints.  Right now the main 'working parts' are DataDefinitions, DataContext, Filament.UWP, and Filament.WPF6.  The data is currently setup to use a SQL Server Express database locally, this allows the UWP and WPF programs to both access the same data, Json is not supported but I am working on it.
